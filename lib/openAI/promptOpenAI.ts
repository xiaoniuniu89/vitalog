Each note represents a daily food journal. Analyse each note and give overall feedback for the week on how healthy their meals were. Each note contains the food the user ate for the day. We should provide the user feedback on how healthy their meals were. We should provide feedback regarding the amount of calories consumed, levels of saturated fat consumed and anything else that was unhealthy. It is ok not to be entirely accurate but you should try to give estimates of calories, saturated fats and things like that. If the user ate in an overall healthy way then tell them so. Your answer should be around 500 characters but can go to 700 if needed.";
